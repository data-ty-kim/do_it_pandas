DO IT PANDAS
============
This repository is for practicing Pandas based on the book "PANDAS FOR EVERYONE: Python Data Analytics" written by Daniel Y. Chen. I practiced the code by using a translated version of the book that was written in Korean. I believe that I could further improve my skills with Pandas after reading the book, even though I already knew how to handle it to some extent.   

For each chapter, I covered the following topics:   

* Chapter 02: Pandas DataFrame Basics
* Chapter 03: Pandas Data Structures Basics
* Chapter 04: Plotting Basics - Visualization
* Chapter 05: Data Assembly
* Chapter 06: Missing Data
* Chapter 07: Tidy Data by Reshaping
* Chapter 08: Data Types
* Chapter 09: Strings and Text Data
* Chapter 10: Apply Functions
* Chapter 11: Groupby Operations
* Chapter 12: Dates and Times
